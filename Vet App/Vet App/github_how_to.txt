Getting Started:
Open Git Bash and run following commands:
 -> cd <your desired location for repo>
 -> git clone https://github.com/Scott-will/Capstone.git
 -> Hopefully everything shows up

Creating A Pull Request:
make sure you are on master branch if not run command
-> git checkout master

Pull latest changes:
-> git pull

create a branch:

git checkout -b new_branch_name // make branch useful name so changes are clear

make your changes.

Once changes are done

-> git status //to see changes to file
-> git add <file path> //add files you changed
-> git commit -m "some changes" //string is some stupid description of what was changed

Next merge latest changes from master branch to avoid merge conflicts:

-> git checkout master
-> git pull
-> git checkout <your_branch>
-> git merge master

Finally if no merge conflicts:
->  git push --set-upstream origin <your_branch>
-> git push

Go to github and create pull request:

go to the repo, click on branches and make a PR for your branch

Some useful commands:

git status to see latest changes
git diff shows line by line changes (dont recommend just download source tree or some similair software)
